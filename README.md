> Pa11y runner for HTML linting with [HTMLHint](https://github.com/htmlhint/HTMLHint).

## Usage

> ðŸš§ Currently the runner is only compatible with PR [#524 â€“Â Add lower-level runner API to support non-browser runners](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/pull/524), and on my fork [thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners).

```sh
npm install -g https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners pa11y-runner-htmlhint
```

With Pa11y and the runner installed,

```sh
pa11y --runner htmlhint https://www.example.com/
```

## Why

HTMLHint isnâ€™t an accessibility checker like other Pa11y runners â€“ itâ€™s a general-purpose HTML linter. Nonetheless, HTMLHint contains a lot of "code smell" linting rules which can be indicative of underlying issues â€“ for example [duplicate attributes](https://htmlhint.com/docs/user-guide/rules/attr-no-duplication) on HTML elements.
